# 08 — RAG Query Layer

**Status: ✅ Done**

## Goal

Provide a conversational interface over the JORT corpus stored in Qdrant. A user types a question in French or Arabic; the system retrieves the most relevant legal articles via hybrid semantic search and streams a grounded answer from a local LLM (Ollama `qwen3:4b`).

## Inputs

- User question (CLI argument or interactive prompt)
- Optional `--year` filter
- Qdrant collection `jort_articles_v2` (Phase 7 output)

## Outputs

- Streamed LLM answer in the user's language, grounded in retrieved articles
- Source citations printed before the answer (law type, number, date)

## Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `rag/query.py` | Main script |
| `BAAI/bge-m3` (via `FlagEmbedding.BGEM3FlagModel`) | Query embedding — same model as indexing |
| `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` (via `FlagEmbedding.FlagReranker`) | Cross-encoder reranking of Qdrant candidates |
| Qdrant `jort_articles_v2` | Hybrid vector search (dense + sparse, RRF) |
| Ollama `qwen3:4b` | Local LLM for answer generation |
| `ollama` Python SDK | Streaming chat API |

## Folder / File Structure

```
rag/
  query.py      ← main script
```

No output files — answers are streamed to stdout.

## Running

```bash
# Prerequisites
docker start qdrant          # Qdrant must be running
ollama serve                 # Ollama must be running
ollama pull qwen3:4b         # model must be pulled

# Single question (French)
python rag/query.py "Quelles sont les obligations des employeurs en matière de sécurité?"

# Single question with year filter
python rag/query.py "Quelles sont les obligations des employeurs?" --year 2024

# Arabic question
python rag/query.py "ما هي حقوق العمال في القانون التونسي؟" --year 2025

# Interactive loop
python rag/query.py --interactive
python rag/query.py --interactive --year 2024
```

Key flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `question` | — | Question (positional arg; omit with `--interactive`) |
| `--year` | — | Filter Qdrant results to a specific year |
| `--top-k` | `5` | Articles passed to the LLM; reranking fetches 20 first |
| `--model` | `qwen3:4b` | Ollama model name |
| `--qdrant-url` | `http://localhost:6333` | Qdrant base URL |
| `--interactive` | `false` | Start an interactive Q&A loop with conversation history |
| `--no-rerank` | `false` | Skip cross-encoder reranking (faster, less precise) |
| `--history-turns` | `5` | Past turns kept in LLM context in interactive mode; `0` = off |
| `--confidence-threshold` | `0.4` | Min reranker score to call the LLM; below this returns "no relevant articles" (ignored with `--no-rerank`) |

## Architecture

## Key Notes / Decisions

- **Same embedding model as indexing.** `BAAI/bge-m3` is used at query time with the same `use_fp16=True` setting to ensure vector space compatibility.
- **`FusionQuery(fusion=Fusion.RRF)` required, not `Fusion.RRF` directly.** In qdrant-client 1.17.x, passing `Fusion.RRF` directly to `query_points` serializes as `{"nearest": "rrf"}` (wrong) instead of `{"fusion": "rrf"}` (correct). Always use `FusionQuery(fusion=Fusion.RRF)`.
- **Language is auto-detected per question.** Arabic Unicode character ratio > 20% → `'ar'`, otherwise `'fr'`. This selects the system prompt language, which content fields are injected as context (`content_french` vs `content_arabic`), and which field the reranker uses as the article text for scoring.
- **Year filter is a Qdrant payload filter** on the indexed `year` keyword field. Passed as `query_filter=Filter(must=[FieldCondition(key="year", match=MatchValue(value=year))])`. **Gotcha:** the `year` field reflects the arrêté's own date, not the JORT issue date. An arrêté signed December 31, 2025 and published in JORT issue 001/2026 is tagged `year: "2025"` — filtering `--year 2026` will miss it.
- **`<think>` token stripping.** `qwen3:4b` is a reasoning model that emits `<think>…</think>` blocks before the actual answer. The streaming loop buffers tokens and suppresses everything inside those tags so only the final answer is printed.
- **Both models loaded lazily.** `_get_model()` loads `BGEM3FlagModel` and `_get_reranker()` loads `FlagReranker` only on first use — the CLI starts instantly and the reranker doesn't load if `--no-rerank` is passed.
- **Reranking fetches a wider candidate pool.** Without `--no-rerank`, Qdrant returns 20 candidates (instead of top_k=5 directly). The cross-encoder then scores each `(question, article_text)` pair jointly — seeing both texts at once — and the top 5 by reranker score are kept. Scores are normalized to [0,1] via sigmoid (`normalize=True`).
- **Conversation history is plain Q&A, not article context.** In interactive mode, past turns are stored as `{"role": "user", "content": plain_question}` + `{"role": "assistant", "content": answer}` — the article context is *not* repeated in history to keep it compact. Fresh articles are retrieved for every new turn. History is trimmed to `--history-turns × 2` messages (default: 10 messages = 5 turns). History is only active in `--interactive` mode; single-shot queries always use an empty history.

## Improvements

### 1. FastAPI endpoint
Expose as `POST /legal_extraction/rag/query` for integration with n8n or a frontend chatbot UI.

### 2. Query expansion / HyDE
Ask the LLM to generate a *hypothetical answer* before embedding ("what would a legal article answering this look like?"), then embed that instead of the raw question. Hypothetical documents sit closer to real articles in embedding space — improves recall for short or vague questions.

### 3. Metadata auto-filtering
The payload has `law_type`, `legal_domains`, `has_obligations`, `has_penalties`, etc. A lightweight classifier on the question could auto-select Qdrant filters before retrieval — e.g. detect "décret" in the question → add `FieldCondition(key="law_type", match="Décret")`.

### 4. Chunking strategy
Articles are currently indexed whole. Long articles dilute retrieval precision. Sliding-window chunking (e.g. 512 tokens, 128 overlap) would improve precision — at the cost of more vectors in Qdrant.

### 5. ✅ Confidence gating *(implemented)*
If the best reranker score is below `--confidence-threshold` (default 0.4), the LLM call is skipped entirely and a bilingual "no relevant articles found" message is returned. Only active when reranking is enabled — ignored with `--no-rerank` since RRF scores are not normalized.

### 6. Source deduplication
If two results share the same `parent_document_id`, keep only the highest-scoring one to avoid the LLM seeing near-identical context twice.
